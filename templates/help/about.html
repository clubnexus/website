Toontown Online was a massively multiplayer Internet game that was closed down on September 19, 2013. 
Toontown Next is a recreation of the closed game that lets you live the life of a Toon.  
Create your own Toon character, furnish your estate, play games with friends, and explore amazing lands.  
Play golf or race with your Toon pals, or relax and go fishing.
The best part is it's always growing, always changing, and as wild as your imagination!</p>

            <p align="justify">Did we mention the Cogs?  These evil robot business types have invaded, 
and it's up to you and your friends to join forces to save Toontown!  Cogs can't take a joke, 
so use your giant arsenal of gags to crack them up.  Get out your seltzer bottles, drop a few safes, 
and let the cream pies fly! These Cogs like to take over Toon buildings and transform them into
sad, grey, Cog Buildings or their dark, sinister, Field Offices!! Grab a group of Toons and storm
their Cog Headquarters, build up your Cog Suit, then defeat the boss of the HQ and help take
back your Toon home!</p>

            <p align="justify">Are YOU Toon enough for this adventure?</p>
