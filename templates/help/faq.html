<h4>What is Toontown Next?</h4>
<p>Toontown Next is a private server based off of the closed MMO, Disney's Toontown Online.</p>

<h4>Where do I play?</h4>
<p>At the moment the game is being finished in the development stage and should launch BETA testing soon. We want to feature a short BETA stage, however, to thoroughly test the game and stress test the server. Nobody likes a glitchy game!</p>

<h4>When will the game be open to the public?</h4>
<p>It may be some time before the final product of the game is released, however BETA testing should be launched soon.</p>

<h4>Will we have to make new Toons?</h4>
<p>Yes, unfortunately, you will need to recreate your Toons, however we have added several nerfs to side features to help improve your experience.</p>

<h4>Will our Toons get deleted after BETA?</h4>
<p>No, your Toon will not get deleted after BETA testing is complete. We plan on moving directly into new content which will be played by higher Toons.</p>

<h4>Will the game be completed when BETA launches or will we have to wait for updates?</h4>
<p>When Toontown Next releases, we will have all of the features Toontown Online had, PLUS almost all of the unused/removed features! We want to feature a short BETA stage, however, to thoroughly test the game and stress test the server. Nobody likes a glitchy game!</p>

<h4>Will BETA testing have a storyline or will it be all about testing the game?</h4>
<p>BETA will not feature a storyline to go along with testing, once the game is completed and launched the final release, then we will add in plots and special events. NOTE: It is BETA testing after all!</p>

<h4>Who is behind Toontown Next?</h4>
<p>The team is currently remaining anonymous, however we can assure you that they are very nice people who want to revive Toontown!</p>

<h4>May I apply to become a moderator or a developer?</h4>
<p>At the time, no. We are not accepting any new staff members at the moment.</p>

<h4>May you upgrade my Toon's stats or change my DNA and/or name?</h4>
<p>Sorry, we will not be changing anything about your Toon unless something happened to it and is the game's fault. We are only liable for anything that happens to your Toon that you did not do.
